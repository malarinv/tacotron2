Thank you for calling Pampers.
How may I help you today?
I understand your frustration and disappointment.
I'm sorry it's happening and I'd like to help prevent it in the future.
What style of Baby Dry did you buy?
Was it the Regular or the Flexible?
I have all the information I need about the specifics of the product you purchased now.
Thank you for your patience!
How many diapers came in the package???
And what size were they?
Were they the small. The medium or the large ones???
Sorry, without the size and count information I will be able to reimburse you with only a minimum fulfillment.
Would that be okay??
So you bought the Pampers Baby Dry and there were 32 diapers in the package.
Is that correct?
Thank you for all that information.'
I will definitely pass on your detailed feedback to our Quality Control Team!
I could also suggest a different variant of diapers, that might better suit your needs.
Would you like me to help you with that?????
How old is your little one?
And do you have specific diaper needs that you can help me with??
Our cruzers are made especially for active babies, and I would definitely suggest them since you said your little one moves around a lot.
What I can do for you is, I can also include a coupon towards your next purchase of Pampers products.
Shall I go ahead with this?
